# DEV-INS-SORT

We have a lot of sorting techniques available like Bubble Sort, Quick Sort etc. 
The sorting technique described here is some what like Insertion Sort. 
#### It can't be named as Insertion Sort so the name DEV-INS-SORT.

## EXPLAINATION
In this sort a key is chosen. The key is compared with the elements before it.
The elements before it is the array of elements which have already been sorted. So it is the sorted array.
The element chosen as a key is compared with each and every element in the sorted array and is placed at it's specific position in the sorted array.
The process goes on till the Array is sorted completely.

A visual example of the same is given in DEV-INS-SORT.pdf
